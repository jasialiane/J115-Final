                  <p>Hi! My name is Jasia Liane (jah-shah lee-anne) and this is a little biography about me.</p>
                
                    <p>    I am currently 21 years old and a rising senior at the University of California, Berkeley. I’m majoring in Media Studies and minoring in Journalism and love all things fun and creative. Growing up, I tried a multitude of things: dance, drawing, instruments, and acting just to name a few. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve found a passion for creating digital content whether it be through photography, videography, or graphic design. With these passions in mind, I am hoping to be able to use this to have a career within the digital marketing space. However, I do not want to be creating content in marketing for just any brand - I want to specifically be able to work within the beauty and fashion industry.</p>
                
                    <p> Beauty and fashion have been another two things I’ve always been drawn to. I recall always trying my best to look different in school with what I wore. When I was in middle school, I vividly remember trying on outfits the night before to ask my parents if it looked okay and although they were supportive, they liked to tease and call it my daily “fashion show.” As I got older, I began to explore the world of skin care and makeup. I found that this was a good way to not only express myself, but to also treat myself as I got busy with extracurriculars and school. To this day, it is still a really big outlet in my life.</p>

                <h2> where i'm from</h2>
                
                <p>Now that I have given a run down of some of my hobbies and passions, you may have noticed that I never stated where I am from. I feel like this is usually one of the easiest questions for people to answer and to help further identify themselves, but for me, it’s not. I was born in Hawaii, but shortly after I moved to California because of my parents’ jobs. Then I moved again. And again. And again.</p>

                <p> In the graphic above, you can see that I’ve moved around a handful of times, and to a lot of different places as well. Growing up, having to move every few years was something that I’m sure any child wouldn’t be too fond of. However, it did give me the amazing chance to be so well traveled at such a young age. Living in Europe meant that going to other countries for a weekend trip or seeing amazing sites was just a day away.</p>

                <h3> interview </h3>
                    <p> Despite being proud to have been able to travel so much when I was younger, I have always been jealous of the people that have been able to stay in one place their entire life. This may sound a bit odd, but as I  moved from place to place, I have met many peers who have had the same friends their entire life (an experience I would never get to have.) While the idea of my literal mobility baffles my friends, I’m equally surprised at their own experiences growing up. With these differences in mind, I decided to interview one of my best friends, Liam, about how he views both his situation as well as mine. </p>
                    
                    <p> Although most of my friends have had growing up in the same area, I think Liam is the epitome of that. His friends that he has known since kindergarten, his friends that live across the street from him, were not only his friends throughout high school, but those that would still be his friends in college. Not even just one, not two, but four of his friends since elementary school would later be his college roommates. </p>
                    
                    <p> “You definitely had a unique upbringing,” he told me. “It has its pros and cons, as you know - like you’re a lot more well traveled than me.”  </p>
                    
                   <p> As we continued to talk, I expressed how I had wished I had been able to have even the opportunity to have the same relationships that he did with his life-long friends. “It really depends what you value more to think if the trade off is worth it. For me, I’d rather be able to grow up with the homies. But you know, I’ve never been to Germany. Or Sweden. And I think there’s a lot of value in that for you.”  </p>
                
                    <p> We continued to talk about our different experiences more. It really gave me insight on not just how much our lifes differed, but also reminded me to be grateful for my unique experience. Despite being in college now and hopefully settling down somewhere as I start my career, I'll always have this unique experience as part of who I am. </p>
